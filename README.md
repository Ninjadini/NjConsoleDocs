# Ninjadini Debug Console [NjConsole] for Unity

This repro is for documentation of [Ninjadini Console](https://u3d.as/3xye).

Rendered version of the docs can be found at   
[https://ninjadini.github.io/njconsole/](https://ninjadini.github.io/njconsole/)

Source `.md` files can be found in `docs/` folder.

We plan to put NjConsole's addons / extension modules inside `extension-modules`.  
Documentation regarding these optional extensions will come soon, perhaps with next release.
